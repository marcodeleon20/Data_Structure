# Data_Structure

This repository contains implementations of various common data structures in programming. Each data structure is designed to provide efficient and optimized functionality, and is presented with clear code examples and detailed explanations.

## Included Data Structures:

- Linked List: Implementation of a linked list that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of elements.

- Queue: Implementation of a queue that follows the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle. It is useful in situations where processing elements in the same order they arrived is required.

- Stack: Implementation of a stack that follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle. It is ideal for tracking states or performing reversible operations.

- Sparse Matrix: Implementation of a sparse matrix that efficiently stores and accesses two-dimensional data with a large number of zero elements.

- Binary Tree: Implementation of a binary tree, a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes with at most two children. It provides efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

- Blockchain: Implementation of a blockchain that uses cryptography to ensure data integrity and non-repudiation. It is particularly useful in applications that require an immutable and transparent record of transactions.

- Hash Table: Implementation of a hash table that provides efficient lookup of elements using a hash function.

## Upcoming Features

We are currently working on integrating a graph visualization tool, Graphviz, to visualize the data structures in an interactive and intuitive manner. Stay tuned for the upcoming updates!

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you wish to add new implementations, improve existing ones, or fix any issues, feel free to do so through pull requests.

We hope this repository proves useful in understanding and utilizing these essential data structures in your software development. Explore the code, experiment, and have fun!
